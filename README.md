# SNOW-AJAX
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. 
AJAX is a technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script.
Ajax uses XHTML for content, CSS for presentation, along with Document Object Model and JavaScript for dynamic content display.
AJAX is a web browser technology independent of web server software.
With AJAX, when you hit submit, JavaScript will make a request to the server, interpret the results, and update the current screen. In the purest sense, the user would never know that anything was even transmitted to the server.
